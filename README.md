# Curriculum Learning on Language Models
<h4>[Report](https://github.com/sid-sr/llm-curriculum-learning/blob/master/Curriculum_Learning_Report.pdf) </h4>
<h3>Notebooks in the "scripts" folder:</h3>
1. perplexity_lstm_training.ipynb: Based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02406.pdf, trains a BILSTM to generate surprisals for each word at fixed checkpoints. (Run on Colab). [Author's code](https://github.com/tylerachang/word-acquisition-language-models/).
2. wordbank_bilstm_aoa_analysis.ipynb: Also based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02406.pdf, compares their provided LSTM AoAs with AO-CHILDES ground truth AoA.
3. portelance_aoa_analysis.ipynb: Based on https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13334, uses their LSTM (and unigram, bigram etc.) surprisals as predictors for AoA (obtained for AO-CHILDES words). Does not train language models, we already have the result files from their code [Author's code](https://github.com/evaportelance/multilingual-aoa-prediction).

<h3>Curriculum Development Using Age of Acquisition and Surprisal:</h3>
The Age of Acquisition (AoA) of a word refers to an estimate of the age at which children produce the word with a probability greater than some threshold, i.e., the age at which children learn a particular word. Existing databases of children’s vocabulary development, such as Stanford’s Wordbank repository (Frank et al., 2016), only contain words with AoAs ranging from 16 to 30 months. By training language models on child-directed speech, researchers have shown that a model’s average surprisal for a given word aids in predicting AoA of that word beyond traditional predictors (Portelance et al., 2023). Our project trains language models (LMs) on AO-CHILDES (Huebner & Willits, 2021), a child-directed speech dataset, to model any word’s AoA
using its average surprisal, extending beyond the words present in Wordbank. We then build a curriculum (Bengio et al., 2009) based on increasing AoA to train LMs such as BabyBERTa (Huebner et al., 2021) with the ordering of words mirroring a child learning English. The AO-CHILDES dataset also provides a ground truth curriculum to use.
